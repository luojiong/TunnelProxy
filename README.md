# TunnelProxy

**TunnelProxy** is an efficient and easy-to-use tool for forwarding remote server ports to local ports. It enables developers to securely tunnel remote services to their local machine and access them as if they were running locally. The tool also supports Chrome DevTools Inspector for real-time debugging, making it a perfect solution for remote service testing and development.

## Introduction

TunnelProxy simplifies the process of accessing remote services by mapping remote ports to local ports. It is especially useful for developers who need to interact with remote APIs, databases, or web applications without complex network configurations. The added support for Chrome DevTools Inspector allows you to debug and optimize your services directly on your local machine, streamlining your workflow.
